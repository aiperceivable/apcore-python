"""Drive `redaction_config.json` — `obs.redaction.*` matching rules (#43 §5, D-54).

observability.md § Redaction configuration says redaction "MUST apply both at
log emission (in `ContextLogger`) and at the executor's input/output capture
point", so this driver replays every fixture case through **both** public entry
points:

* :class:`~apcore.observability.ContextLogger` — the log-emission path; the
  fixture input becomes the ``extra`` dict of one JSON log record.
* :func:`apcore.utils.redaction.redact_sensitive` — Algorithm A13, the
  input/output capture path used by ``builtin_steps``.

Driving only one of them would leave half the mandated surface unverified —
and that is exactly how the correlation-field MUST came to be violated on both:
the exemption lived in a flat helper neither path called.

Two shapes of case
------------------

*Rule cases* carry a ``redaction_config`` block and pin behaviour GIVEN a set of
rules. *Config-key cases* name their dot-paths directly (``config``, or
``config_canonical`` plus a per-SDK ``legacy_key_by_sdk``) and pin WHICH key path
an implementation consults to obtain those rules — the fixture's
``driver_contract.which_key_is_read_is_part_of_the_contract``. The second shape
exists because behaviour-given-a-config cannot catch an implementation that
reads the wrong key: apcore-rust read only the legacy ``observability.redaction.*``
path, so an operator writing the documented ``obs.redaction.sensitive_keys`` had
their configuration silently discarded (apcore-rust#32). Config-key cases are
therefore built by writing the exact dot-path the case names into a real
:class:`~apcore.config.Config` and reading it back through
:meth:`RedactionConfig.from_config` — never by constructing the RedactionConfig
directly, which would skip the very step under test.

The discriminating payload matters as much as the key path: ``username`` matches
NO entry of the canonical default list while ``password`` and ``_secret_token``
both do, so the expected map can distinguish "the override was read and replaced
the defaults" from "the defaults are in force". A payload whose keys all match a
default anyway stays green under both behaviours, which is why this defect
survived in every SDK.
