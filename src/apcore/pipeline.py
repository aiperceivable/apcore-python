    A ``run_until`` predicate is the exception, and deliberately so: it is
    evaluated *after* the step it judges, so ``outputs`` there does include
    ``step_name``.

    ``outputs`` is a **live reference** to the engine's map, not a copy — the
    same aliasing apcore-typescript has. Read it (or copy it) inside the hook:
    a middleware that stashes the state object and inspects it after the run

class StepMiddleware(Protocol):
    """Protocol for pipeline step middlewares (Issue #33 §2.2).

    Step middlewares wrap individual pipeline steps the same way module
    middlewares wrap whole module calls.  All three hooks are optional and
    each method may be either synchronous or ``async``.

    Hook semantics (middleware-system.md § "Pipeline Step Middleware", pinned
    by ``conformance/fixtures/pipeline_step_middleware.json``):

    * ``before_step(step_name, state)`` — invoked just before the step runs, in
      **registration order**.  It is an *observation* hook: a Step is
      ``execute(ctx)`` and takes no ``inputs`` argument, so the return value
      carries no meaning and MUST NOT change what the step body sees.  Input
      rewriting is the module-level ``Middleware.before`` contract.
      An exception raised here is wrapped in :class:`MiddlewareChainError`,
      stops the chain (the step body does NOT run), and triggers
      ``on_step_error`` on only the middlewares whose ``before_step`` already
      executed.  **That failure is terminal** — see below.
    * ``after_step(step_name, state, result)`` — invoked after a successful
      step **and after a recovered one**, in **reverse registration order**
      (onion model).  A recovered step produced an output and the pipeline
      continued, so the onion MUST close or the recovery path leaks whatever
      ``before_step`` acquired.  It is NOT invoked when the step failed
      unrecovered, and NOT invoked after a ``before_step`` failure.
    * ``on_step_error(step_name, state, error)`` — invoked when a step raises,
      in **reverse registration order**.  The FIRST handler returning a
      non-``None`` value supplies the recovery result and short-circuits the
      remaining handlers (first-recovery-wins); the original error does not
      propagate.  Returning ``None`` from every handler lets the original
      exception propagate (subject to the step's ``ignore_errors``).
      A handler that itself raises is logged and iteration continues.

    **``state.outputs`` never contains the current step**, in any of the three
    hooks — it holds exactly the steps that completed before ``step_name``.
    ``before_step`` has not run it; ``on_step_error`` has no output to record;
    and in ``after_step`` the current step's output is the ``result``
    argument.  The alternative reading, "outputs of completed steps", would
    make ``after_step`` the one hook whose ``outputs`` differs in shape, so a
    middleware would have to know which hook it was in before reading the map.

    **A ``before_step`` failure terminates the step — it is not recoverable.**
    A ``before_step`` failure and a step-body failure are categorically
    different and MUST NOT share a recovery path.  On the ``before_step`` path
    ``on_step_error`` still runs, on the already-entered middlewares, in
    reverse order — but for *observation and cleanup only*: any value it
    returns is **discarded**, ``after_step`` does not fire, and the step's
    ``ignore_errors`` does not apply.  ``MiddlewareChainError`` propagates
    regardless.  Honouring the recovery would advance the pipeline past a step
    whose body never ran, and ``acl_check`` / ``approval_gate`` sit in the
    built-in strategy, so it is a silent authorization bypass reachable from an
    extension point that carries no authority.

    Both sync and async returns are supported: the engine awaits any return
    value that ``inspect.isawaitable()`` reports as awaitable, mirroring the
    pattern used by Issue #42's async ``on_error`` fix.

    Deliberately a SEPARATE helper from :func:`_invoke_on_step_error` rather

    recovery-seeking one is unsafe here:

    * every return value is DISCARDED — a broken middleware chain is not
      recoverable, so nothing a handler returns may become the step's output or
      let the pipeline continue; and
    * **first-recovery-wins MUST NOT apply.** Short-circuiting exists to stop
      shopping for a recovery once one is found; no recovery is being sought
      here, so **every** already-entered middleware MUST be notified.  Stopping
      at the first one that happens to return a value would strand the cleanup
      of every middleware registered behind it — the opposite of what this pass
      is for.

    Reverse registration order still holds: cleanup unwinds the onion in the
    order the middlewares were entered.  Mirrors apcore-typescript
    ``_runStepCleanupHooks``.  See middleware-system.md § "A `before_step`
    failure terminates the step — it is not recoverable".
