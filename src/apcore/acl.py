    :func:`_validate_effect` is one function: two copies of a value set are two
    things that drift, which is how the loader came to be the only door that
    checked ``effect``.

    A pattern array is **FLAT** (§6.2.1). The operators do not nest, there is no
    precedence, an operand is always a plain pattern string, and there is
    exactly one operator position — index 0. So the shape is finite, decidable

    2. every element MUST be a non-empty string;

    4. ``$not`` at index 0 MUST be followed by **exactly** one;
    5. ``$or`` / ``$not`` MUST NOT appear at any index other than 0.

    Through spec v1.30.0 none of this was enforced anywhere, while
    ``schemas/acl-config.schema.json`` had declared ``minItems: 1`` and

    #111's shape, in which the normative artefact declared the constraint and no
    entry point enforced it. The matcher read the arity fault as a *scope*
    decision and returned False, which makes an ``allow`` rule merely useless
    and a ``deny`` rule a **fail-open**: under ``default_effect: allow`` the call
    the operator wrote the rule to block was permitted, by a rule that loaded
    without error and a validator that called it clean.

    plus ``approval: required``" requires knowing the effect — but it states no
    order, which is why three implementations had three: ``{callers: [],
    targets: [], effect: "Allow"}`` was refused for its ``effect`` in one and
    for its patterns in another, and a third ran ``effect`` -> patterns ->
    ``approval``. All were conformant, because nothing said otherwise.

    ``effect`` comes first because the pairing rule below it is read *off* the
    effect: ``effect: "DENY"`` with ``approval: required`` is not a ``deny``
    rule, so reporting the pairing would name a rule the specification does not
    recognise.

    before ``targets``. Only the shape half is a door rejection here; the type
    fault is unrepresentable in apcore-rust, so it is reported by
    :meth:`ACL._precheck_patterns`, which gives it the same precedence within
    the same field order.

    **Rule index dominates all three axes** (§6.2.1). A rule *set* with more
    than one bad rule MUST be refused for the LOWEST-INDEXED bad rule, and an
    implementation MUST NOT sweep one axis across every rule before looking at
    the next. That is a property of the callers rather than of this function:
    :meth:`ACL.load` validates rule by rule in file order, and ``ACL(rules=[...])``
    validates each :class:`ACLRule` as it is constructed, so both refuse the
    first bad rule rather than the first bad axis. Sweeping is how one
    implementation came to report a lower-indexed rule's pattern fault from its
    loader and a higher-indexed rule's ``effect`` fault from its constructor,
    for the same file.

    **One function, called at every door**, which is §6.2.1's first point of
    order: a rule offered to :meth:`ACL.add_rule` MUST be validated *at that
    moment*, whatever its history — including a rule that was
    well-formed when constructed and has since had ``callers`` or ``targets``
    assigned — and an implementation MUST NOT rely on the rule type's own

        A value that is not a list of strings is a malformed rule, not a pattern
        set. A bare string is iterable, so ``callers: "admin.*"`` written where
        ``callers: ["admin.*"]`` was meant is read character by character — and
        ``*`` is a valid pattern matching everything, so an ``allow`` rule
        carrying that typo granted access to **every caller**. A non-subscriptable
        scalar raised ``TypeError`` out of ``check()``, which its contract forbids.

        Since spec v1.31.0 (§6.2.1, #112) the **arity** is checked here too. That
        half is the backstop for the one route no door covers: :class:`ACLRule`
        is a non-frozen dataclass, so ``rule.targets = []`` reaches the evaluator
        whatever the constructors check. §6.1.5's v1.30.0 reasoning for why the
        ``effect`` closure needs no backstop — the value is never read again once
        the doors are shut — does **not** transfer, because a mutated pattern
        array *is* read: the matcher consults it on the next ``check()``. An
        array outside §6.2.1's closure is therefore a precheck fault on exactly
        the same terms as a malformed type: the rule's scope is unreadable, the
        rule is UNEVALUABLE, and §6.1.1's effect table decides — a ``deny`` rule
        takes effect and denies, an ``allow`` rule does not match and MUST NOT
        grant. §6.1.4.1 has no partially-readable tier: ``targets: []`` is
        legible as an empty scope in a way ``targets: 3`` is not, and acting on
        that difference is the per-implementation judgement call that produced
        three different answers in #100.

        Tier 2 — an array that is well-formed under every clause above and still
        matches nothing — is deliberately **not** here. It is
        :meth:`_never_matches`, and it feeds :meth:`validate_rules` alone.

        Both fields are examined; the check does not stop at the first fault, so
        the finding set is a pure function of the rule (§6.1.4 determinism). At

        before — ``["$not", "*"]`` on a ``deny`` rule under
        ``default_effect: allow`` still lets an unrelated call through.

        Why a finding and not a rejection. Closing §6.2.1's arities does not
        exhaust the inert class — ``["$not", "*"]`` has perfectly legal arity,

        relation** rather than the array's shape, and that predicate cannot be
        closed without freezing the pattern language. §6.1.4's determinism
        guarantee binds precheck-origin diagnostics because they feed
        ``handler_error`` and the decision; tier-2 findings feed neither, so a
        divergence between SDKs is a missed diagnostic rather than an ACL file
        that loads in one language and fails in another. §6.1.3 governs: this is
        diagnostics, not enforcement.

        The criterion is normative and this list is §6.2.1's MUST-detect

        ``validate_conditions`` because it reports structural faults in
        ``callers`` and ``targets`` as well (§6.1.4.1), not only condition keys.

        Since spec v1.31.0 (§6.2.1, #112) it is also the **only** reader of
        :meth:`_never_matches` — tier 2, an array that is well-formed under
        every structural clause and still matches no legal module ID. Such a
        rule protects nothing and MUST be reported, but it MUST NOT be rejected
        and MUST NOT change any access decision; the finding carries the same
        shape as a structural fault (path ``callers`` / ``targets``, a **null**
        key, both resolvability flags False), so a reader cannot tell the tiers
        apart and does not need to.

        Loading an ACL only warns, because handler registration is a runtime,
        process-wide act that legitimately happens after discovery; this method
        is what a deployment calls once registration is complete, so it can turn
        a broken rule into a startup error of its own choosing.

        A finding is emitted whenever ``sync_resolvable`` is false — **including**
        when ``async_resolvable`` is true (§6.1.3 rule 3). An async-only handler
        is a working condition under :meth:`async_check` and an unevaluable one
        under :meth:`check`; an application that only ever calls ``async_check``
        may ignore such a finding, but that judgement belongs to the caller, not
        to the validator.

            at several positions, which leaves ordering by key undefined. Empty
            means every rule currently passes the precheck on the sync path; it
            is not a guarantee about the future, since a later :meth:`add_rule`

        directory of the config's source file when known (``config.source_path``),
        otherwise relative to the current working directory.

        ``acl.root`` is a directory by spec convention (``acl/{scope}_acl.yaml``,

        conventional ``global_acl.yaml`` within it is loaded; if that file is

        the resolved path is itself a file, it is loaded directly. Either way the
        actual load goes through :meth:`load`.

        Critical invariant: a missing path returns ``None`` and attaches NOTHING.
        It MUST NOT synthesize an empty default-deny ACL — doing so would silently
        deny every inter-module call in every project that lacks an ``acl`` dir.
        Missing path means "no enforcement", identical to pre-D-64 behavior. The

        is loaded (it is read by :meth:`load` from the ACL file itself); it never

        could not be evaluated (PROTOCOL_SPEC §6.1.1) — which the caller resolves
        toward refusing access.

        Order is normative (§6.1.4 rule 4):

        a. The **structure** of ``callers`` / ``targets`` is prechecked before any
           pattern is read, because reading a malformed one is the §6.1.4.1
           fail-open.
        b. A malformed pattern field makes the rule unevaluable — its scope is
           unknowable, so it resolves per §6.1.1's effect table.
        c. Both fields well-formed and either failing to match means the rule
           **does not apply to this call**. Its conditions are not consulted, its
           faults do not reach ``handler_error``, and it does not change this
           decision. Otherwise one misspelled key in a narrowly scoped rule would
           decide calls it was never written about — ``callers: ["api.*"]`` with
           a typo'd condition denying a ``worker.*`` caller — which breaks
           first-match-wins. The fault is still real; :meth:`validate_rules`
           looks at every rule and no call, and is where it surfaces.
        d. Only then is the conditions tree prechecked, in full and context-free,
           **before** §6.5's no-context check. That ordering closes the bypass
           where ``conditions: {mispelled: true}`` on a ``deny`` rule passed
           traffic simply because the caller carried no identity.

        A rule that *passes* the precheck and then finds no context takes §6.5's
        path and does not match. ``roles`` is answerable in principle; this
        caller merely supplied no input for it.

        the posture that field already produces under ``deny``, where an
        unreadable scope denies every call.

        The ``effect == "allow"`` test is the exact complement of the caller's

                (PROTOCOL_SPEC §6.1.6).

        Raises:
            ACLRuleError: When ``effect`` is outside ``allow`` / ``deny``
                (§6.1.5), when ``approval="required"`` is combined with
                ``effect="deny"``, which §6.1.6 makes meaningless, or when
                ``callers`` / ``targets`` is outside §6.2.1's closed shape —
                empty, ``$or`` with no operand, ``$not`` with none or more than
                one, an empty pattern string, or a reserved token anywhere but
                index 0 (spec v1.31.0). Runtime insertion is one of the three
                entry points §6.1.6 rule 3 requires all of these checks at; this
                method returning ``None`` is not an exemption, so it signals the
                way Python signals a value that cannot be constructed.

                The rule is validated **here**, on the object this method is
                handed, and not only by :class:`ACLRule`'s own constructor
                (§6.2.1). A pre-built rule may have been well-formed when it was
                constructed and had ``callers`` or ``targets`` assigned since —
                :class:`ACLRule` is a non-frozen dataclass — and such a rule
                reaches this door without passing through any constructor.

        Note:
            A condition key with no registered handler warns and does not
            raise, exactly as on :meth:`load` (PROTOCOL_SPEC §6.1.2 rule 4).
            The warning names index ``0``, where the rule lands.
